# This file is one of the central points in the Shotgun Pipeline Toolkit configuration and
# a counterpart to the folder configuration structure.
#
# The folder structure underneath the project folder is used to create folders on disk -
# templates.yml (this file) refers to those folders. Therefore, the two files need to be
# in sync. This file contains an overview of all locations that are used by Sgtk.
#
# Whenever an app or an engine refers to a location on disk, it is using an entry defined in
# this file. For more information, see the Shotgun Pipeline Toolkit Documentation.

# The keys section contains the definitions for all the different keys that are being
# used by Sgtk. A key is a magic token that is replaced by a value at runtime, for example
# {Shot}. The section below tells Sgtk which data types and formats to expect for each key.

# The strings section is similar to the paths section - but rather than defining paths

# able to configure the way data is written to shotgun - it may be the name field for a
# review version or the formatting of a publish.
